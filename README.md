# CommunityApp
Use ReactNative to create a simple community management app.

To run the app,
(1) Download the codes.
(2) Enter your project folder and execute "npm install" command.
    (This can help you download packages from package.json)
(3) execute "npm start" and scan QR code. (I usually use tunnel to connect my phone)
