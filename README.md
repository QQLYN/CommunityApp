# CommunityApp
Use ReactNative to create a simple community management app.

To run the app,<br>
(1) Download the codes.<br>
(2) Enter your project folder and execute "npm install" command. (This can help you download packages from package.json)<br>
(3) Execute "npm start" and scan QR code. (I usually use tunnel to connect my phone)<br>
<br>
Try it and create your own app!
